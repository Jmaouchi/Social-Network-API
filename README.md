# About The Application:
  Full stack web application usind heroku and JAWSdb. 
  Our team of experts have spent a lifetime enjoying coffee from all over the world. As our travels take us to various countries, we enjoy connecting with the culture through the coffee they enjoy most, or the coffee they find special.

# Technology

**1. [JavaScript](https;//javascript.com/)**



**4. [Mongoose](https://Mongoose.com/)**: 

* Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoD


**5. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**:

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and   mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.


**12. [nodemon](https;//nodemon.com/)** :

* nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) utility developed by @rem that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and automatically restarts the process
